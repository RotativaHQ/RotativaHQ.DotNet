    1. Your Agreement with RavenHQ
    1.1. Your use of the RavenHQ service (the "Service") is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "RavenHQ" means RavenHQ LLC, located in Grapevine, TX 76051, United States and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Service. The "Service" means the services RavenHQ makes available through this website, our API and any other software or services offered by RavenHQ in connection to any of those.

    1.2. In order to use the Service, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Service. You understand and agree that RavenHQ will treat your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

    1.3. You may not use the Service if you are a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Service. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children under 13.

    2. Your Account and Use of the Service
    2.1. You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Service. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify RavenHQ immediately.

    2.2. Your use of the Service must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.

    2.3. You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Service by any means other than through the interface that is provided by RavenHQ in connection with the Service, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with RavenHQ, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

    3. Service Policies and Privacy
    3.1. You agree to comply with the RavenHQ Acceptable Use Policy included available at https://ravenhq.zendesk.com/entries/21400068-Acceptable-Use-Policy (or such URL as RavenHQ may provide) (the "Acceptable Use Policy") which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.

    3.2. The Service shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Service available at https://ravenhq.zendesk.com/entries/21387313-Privacy-Policy (or such URL as RavenHQ may provide). You agree to the use of your data in accordance with RavenHQ's privacy policies.

    3.3. You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to RavenHQ.

    4. Fees for Use of the Service
    4.1. Subject to the Terms, the Service is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at http://ravenhq.com/pricing.html (or such URL as RavenHQ may provide).

    4.2. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.

    4.3. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for the Service using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be made without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services by giving you at least 30 days’ advance notice. We may charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.

    4.4. Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees RavenHQ incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on RavenHQ's measurements of your use of the Service, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of RavenHQ and only in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in these Terms obligates RavenHQ to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to RavenHQ may be shared by RavenHQ with companies who work on RavenHQ's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to RavenHQ and servicing your account. RavenHQ may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. RavenHQ shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. RavenHQ reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Service to you for any late payments.

    4.5. RavenHQ may change its fees and payment policies for the Service with thirty (30) days prior notice. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted in the Service FAQ or at https://ravenhq.zendesk.com/entries/21396176-Terms-of-Service (or such other URL RavenHQ may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.

    4.6. You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Service in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

    5. Content in the Service and Take Down Obligations
    5.1. You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Service are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the "Content".

You acknowledge and agree that RavenHQ (or RavenHQ's licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Service (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

    6.2. Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with RavenHQ, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of RavenHQ's trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

    6.3.

Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with RavenHQ, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that RavenHQ has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

    7. License from RavenHQ and Restrictions
    7.1. RavenHQ gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by RavenHQ as part of the Service as provided to you by RavenHQ. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by RavenHQ, in the manner permitted by the Terms.

    7.2. You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to): (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Service or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by RavenHQ, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Service or any Application; (c) use the Service to create an Application that performs a malicious activity, including but not limited to spamming users, harvesting usernames and passwords, performing unauthorized scans of machines or ports or creating DoS attacks; or (d) upload or otherwise process any malicious content to or through the Service.

    7.3. Unless RavenHQ has given you specific written permission to do so (e.g., through an open source software license), you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Service, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Service, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Service.

    7.4. Open source software licenses for components of the Service released under an open source license constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with RavenHQ for the use of the components of the Service released under an open source license.

    8. License from You
    8.1. RavenHQ claims no ownership or control over any Content or Application. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in the Content and/or Application, and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying the Content on or through the Service you give RavenHQ a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Content for the sole purpose of enabling RavenHQ to provide you with the Service in accordance with its privacy policy. Furthermore, by creating an Application through use of the Service, you give RavenHQ a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Application for the sole purpose of enabling RavenHQ to provide you with the Service in accordance with its privacy policy.

    8.2. You agree that RavenHQ, in its sole discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of the Service.

    9. Modification and Termination of the Service
    9.1. RavenHQ is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Service which RavenHQ provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in Sections 4.5 and 11.2. Changes to the form and nature of the Service will be effective with respect to all versions of the Service (including the Deprecated Version of the Service); examples of changes to the form and nature of the Service include without limitation changes to fee and payment policies, security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.

    9.2. If RavenHQ in its discretion chooses to cease providing the current version of the Service whether through discontinuation of the Service or by upgrading the Service to a newer version, the current version of the Service will be deprecated and become the Deprecated Version of the Service. RavenHQ will issue an announcement if the current version of the Service will be deprecated. For a period of 3 years after an announcement (the “Deprecation Period”), RavenHQ will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate the Deprecated Version of the Service and to respond to problems with the Deprecated Version of the Service deemed by RavenHQ in its discretion to be critical. During the Deprecation Period, no new features will be added to the Deprecated Version of the Service.

    RavenHQ reserves the right in its discretion to cease providing all or any part of the Deprecated Version of the Service immediately without any notice if:

    (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or

    (B) RavenHQ is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision of the Deprecated Version of the Service); or

    (C) the Deprecated Version of the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires RavenHQ to change the way RavenHQ provides the data or services through the Deprecated Version of the Service; or

    (D) providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by RavenHQ in its reasonable good faith judgment; or

    (E) providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden as determined by RavenHQ in its reasonable good faith judgment.

    At any time prior to discontinuing the current version of the Service or upgrading to a new version of the Service, RavenHQ may, in its discretion as part of its continuing innovation to provide the best possible experience for its users, label certain features or functionality of the Service as "experimental." This Section 9.2 of the Terms will not apply to any features or functionality labeled as "experimental."

    This Section 9.2 of the Terms also will not apply to the Service (as defined in Section 7.1).

    9.3. You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time. RavenHQ may, at any time, terminate your use of the Service if (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or (B) RavenHQ is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision of the Service); or (C) the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires RavenHQ to change the way RavenHQ provides the data or services through the Service; or (D) providing the Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by RavenHQ in its reasonable good faith judgment; or (E) providing the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden as determined by RavenHQ in its reasonable good faith judgment.

    9.4. If RavenHQ suspends or terminates your use of the Service with cause, RavenHQ will make a reasonable effort to give you access to, and the ability to export, your Content and Application(s) for a reasonable amount of time. If you voluntarily discontinue your use of the Service, you are solely responsible for exporting your Content and Application(s) prior to discontinuation.

    9.5. Upon any termination of the Service under Sections 4 or 9 , these Terms will also terminate, but Sections 6.1, 10, 11, 12, and 16 shall continue to be effective after these Terms are terminated.

    10. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES
